## About this project
Thanks to [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) Channel. I found this tutorial on Youtube and you can find the link to the video at the bottom, inside the Reference part.

It is quite an interesting project which gives me an overview of how to develop a modern personal portfolio by using React, Next.js and style components also it is a good practice for developers who wants to try something new.

<br/>

There are some typos in the project; just leave them or if you like, you can fix them by yourself. I will fix it in the next stage.
